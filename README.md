Project_CARBON_EATER
This is the detection part of the prototype phase carbon eater. Humanity tries to achieve carbon neutrality by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, but unfortunately, every essential basic need whether going to grocery store or school, leaves behind a carbon footprintimage To make our earth a better place to live, we will utilize the knowledge of colloidal particles and the new advanced technology of machine learning and artificial intelligence to capture carbon emissions from the air.
